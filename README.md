# NIDS_using_RandomForest
# Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using Random Forest

## Overview
This project utilizes a **Random Forest classifier** to detect network intrusions. The model is trained on the **NSL-KDD dataset** and evaluates network traffic for potential threats like DoS, R2L, U2R, and probing attacks.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans, encodes, and splits data into training and testing sets.
- **Random Forest Model**: Utilizes Random Forest to classify traffic into normal and attack categories.
- **Evaluation**: Performance evaluated through accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
